# Timeline Optimization Plan

## Current Issues
- Performance degradation with many clips
- Complex alignment calculations
- Full re-render on every change

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Virtual Rendering (Highest Priority)
**Problem**: Currently renders all clips, even ones off-screen
**Solution**: Only render clips visible in viewport

```javascript
function getVisibleClips() {
  const scrollLeft = timelineScrollWrapper.scrollLeft;
  const viewportWidth = timelineScrollWrapper.clientWidth;
  const startTime = scrollLeft / timelineZoom;
  const endTime = (scrollLeft + viewportWidth) / timelineZoom;
  
  return timelineClips.filter(clip => {
    const clipStart = clip.startTime || 0;
    const clipDuration = clip.outPoint > 0 ? (clip.outPoint - clip.inPoint) : clip.duration;
    const clipEnd = clipStart + clipDuration;
    return clipEnd >= startTime && clipStart <= endTime;
  });
}
```

### 2. Canvas-Based Rendering (Optional, if performance becomes critical)
- Use HTML5 Canvas for clip rendering
- Much faster for 20+ clips
- More complex but better performance

### 3. Debounced Updates
- Throttle position updates during drag (use requestAnimationFrame)
- Batch DOM updates

### 4. Simplified Layout
- Use CSS `transform: translateX()` instead of `left` positioning (GPU accelerated)
- Consider using CSS Grid for clip positioning

### 5. Incremental Improvements
- Cache calculated positions
- Use DocumentFragment for batch DOM insertions
- Minimize style recalculations

## Implementation Priority
1. ✅ Keep current DOM-based approach (already working)
2. ⭐ Add virtual rendering (biggest performance win)
3. ⭐ Optimize drag operations with throttling
4. Consider Canvas only if >50 clips becomes common

## Best Practices Already Implemented
- ✅ Multi-track support
- ✅ Smart snapping
- ✅ Free positioning with gaps
- ✅ Drag and drop
- ✅ Zoom controls
- Square thumbnails/visual feedback

## Recommendations

**For your use case**: Keep custom implementation, add virtual rendering.

**Alternative libraries to consider** (if rewriting):
- **React Timeline**: Not applicable (vanilla JS)
- **Konva.js**: Canvas-based, could work but major refactor
- **Fabric.js**: Similar to Konva, overkill for this
- **Custom Canvas**: Would require significant rewrite

**My recommendation**: **Keep and optimize** - your current approach is fine, just needs virtual rendering for better performance.
